# C++ Sorting Algorithms

## Repository Overview

This repository contains implementations of three fundamental sorting algorithms in C++: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort. Developed during my coursework at Portland State University, these programs serve as a practical exercise in understanding and applying basic sorting techniques in C++.

## Included Algorithms

- **Selection Sort (`selectionSort.cpp`)**: Implements the selection sort algorithm, sorting characters in a string. Detailed comments and output to both the console and `selection.txt` provide insight into the process and final result.

- **Bubble Sort (`bubbleSort.cpp`)**: A modified version of bubble sort that alternates direction with each pass. The output is provided to both the console and `output.txt`, demonstrating the sorting process and the final outcome.

- **Merge Sort (`mergeSort.cpp`)**: Implements the merge sort algorithm using recursion. Outputs the sorting process step-by-step to both the console and `merge.txt`, illustrating the algorithm's stability and efficiency.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained a deeper understanding of basic sorting algorithms and their implementation in C++.
- Enhanced problem-solving skills through algorithm modification and optimization.
- Improved proficiency in C++ programming, particularly in using arrays, file I/O, and recursion.

## Running the Programs

To run these programs:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the desired C++ file (e.g., `g++ -o selectionSort selectionSort.cpp`).
3. Execute the compiled file (e.g., `./selectionSort`).

Each program outputs the sorting process and the final sorted array to both the console and an associated text file.
